# Simulating the dataset: both projection class (as different animals) and sublayer (within animals)

## Overview

This code simulates 5 main types of cells as a mouse runs along a virtual linear track. 
 - Spatial
 - Reward-modulated
 - Landmark
 - Boundary
 - Non-place cells

## Simulating specific subpopulations of place cells;

#### Figure 1: simulating 2 mice with 2 populations of cells per mouse
*Mouse #1 = LS-projecting, deep and superficial populations recorded simultaneously*
*Mouse #2 = EC-projecting, deep and superficial populations recorded simultaneously*
